        <p class="intro">In the digital age, mastering not just the art of photography but also the science of reaching your audience is crucial. Search engine optimization (SEO) plays a significant role in ensuring your photography gets the recognition it deserves. Explore these five SEO-friendly tips to elevate your photography website's visibility and attract more viewers.</p>
        
        <ol class="tips">
            <li>Target Relevant Keywords: Begin your SEO journey by researching and incorporating relevant keywords into your website content. Consider phrases like "portrait photography," "landscape photography tips," or "wedding photography inspiration." Tools like Google Keyword Planner can help you identify popular keywords in your niche.</li>
        
            <li>Optimize Image Metadata: Don't forget the importance of image metadata, which includes file names, alt tags, and descriptions. When uploading your photographs, use descriptive file names like "sunset-beach-photography.jpg" instead of generic ones. Add alt tags that describe the image content, enhancing accessibility and SEO.</li>
        
            <li>Publish High-Quality Content: Google values informative and engaging content. Write blog posts or articles related to your photography niche. Share tips, stories, and insights that will resonate with your audience. When you offer valuable information, you not only showcase your expertise but also improve your website's SEO ranking.</li>
        
            <li>Mobile-Friendly Design: Ensure your photography website is mobile-responsive. With the majority of internet users accessing websites through mobile devices, Google rewards mobile-friendly sites with better rankings. A responsive design guarantees a seamless user experience and boosts your SEO.</li>
        
            <li>Build Backlinks: Backlinks, or links from other reputable websites to yours, are a powerful SEO tool. Collaborate with photography-related blogs, forums, or social media platforms to share your work and expertise. These links not only drive traffic but also improve your website's authority in the eyes of search engines.</li>
